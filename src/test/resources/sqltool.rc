# This is a sample RC configuration file used by SqlTool, DatabaseManager,
# and any other program that uses the org.hsqldb.util.RCData class.

# You can run SqlTool right now by copying this file to your home directory
# and running
#    java -jar /path/to/hsqldb.jar mem
# This will access the first urlid definition below in order to use a 
# personal Memory-Only database.

# If you have the least concerns about security, then secure access to
# your RC file.
# See the documentation for SqlTool for various ways to use this file.

# A personal Memory-Only database.

url jdbc:hsqldb:mem:memdbid

# This is for a hsqldb Server running with default settings on your local
# computer (and for which you have not changed the password for "sa").

# Template for a urlid for an Oracle database.
# You will need to put the oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver class into your 
# classpath.
# In the great majority of cases, you want to use the file classes12.zip
# (which you can get from the directory $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib of any
# Oracle installation compatible with your server).
# Since you need to add to the classpath, you can't invoke SqlTool with
# the jar switch, like "java -jar .../hsqldb.jar..." or 
# "java -jar .../hsqlsqltool.jar...".
# Put both the HSQLDB jar and classes12.zip in your classpath (and export!)
# and run something like "java org.hsqldb.util.SqlTool...".

# Template for a TLS-encrypted HSQLDB Server.
# Remember that the hostname in hsqls (and https) JDBC URLs must match the
# CN of the server certificate (the port and instance alias that follows 
# are not part of the certificate at all).
# You only need to set "truststore" if the server cert is not approved by
# your system default truststore (which a commercial certificate probably
# would be).
